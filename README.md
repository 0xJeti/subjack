Subjack is a Hostile Subdomain Takeover tool written in Go designed to scan a list of subdomains concurrently and identify ones that are able to be hijacked. With Go's speed and efficiency, this tool really stands out when it comes to mass-testing. Always double check the results manually to rule out false positives.

**New:**
> Subjack now has a subdomain discovery option that uses [Jeff Foley](https://twitter.com/@jeff_foley)'s [amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass) to discover subdomains and test them immediately.

Subjack uses amass integration to:
- enumerate subdomains of a specified domain or from a list of domains.
- brute force subdomains with a wordlist.
- enumerate subdomains recursively and/or with alterations.
- save subdomains enumerated with amass integration.

**Also New:**
Subjack will check for subdomains attached to domains that don't exist (NXDOMAIN) and are **available to be registered**. No need for dig ever again! This is still cross-compatible too.

## Installing

Requires [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) >= 1.10.

`go get -u github.com/haccer/subjack`

## How To Use:

Examples: 
- `./subjack -w subdomains.txt -t 100 -timeout 30 -o results.txt -ssl`
- `./subjack -d example.com -brute -w subdomain_wordlist.txt`
- `./subjack -dL domains.txt -alts -save subdomains.txt -o results.txt`

Options:
- `-d domain.com` is a domain you want to gather subdomains for with [amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass).
- `-w domains.txt` is your list of subdomains.
- `-t` is the number of threads (Default: 10 threads). 
- `-timeout` is the seconds to wait before timeout connection (Default: 10 seconds).
- `-o results.txt` where to save results to.
- `-ssl` enforces HTTPS requests which may return a different set of results and increase accuracy.
- `-a` skips CNAME check and sends requests to every URL.
- `-save subdomains.txt` is to save subdomains enumerated with amass (Use with -d or -dL).
- `-dL domains.txt` is a list of domains to enumerate subdomains using amass.
- `-brute` enables subdomain brute forcing (Use with -d or -dL).
- `-r` enables recursive subdomain brute forcing (Use with -d or -dL).
- `-alts` enables subdomain alterations (Use with -d or -dL).

## Practical Use

You can use [scanio.sh](https://gist.github.com/haccer/3698ff6927fc00c8fe533fc977f850f8) which is kind of a PoC script to mass-locate vulnerable subdomains using results from Rapid7's Project Sonar. This script parses and greps through the dump for desired CNAME records and makes a large list of subdomains to check with subjack if they're vulnerable to Hostile Subdomain Takeover. Of course this isn't the only method to get a large amount of data to test. **Please use this responsibly ;)**

## Docker
```
docker run --name subjack --rm -v <path to wordlist or save dir>:/data c0dy/subjack
```

## FAQ
**Q:** What should my wordlist look like?

**A:** Your wordlist should include a list of subdomains you're checking and should look something like:
```
assets.cody.su
assets.github.com
b.cody.su
big.example.com
cdn.cody.su
dev.cody.su
dev2.twitter.com
```

**Q:** I ran my scan and nothing happened. What does this mean?

**A:** In most cases, this means that subjack didn't discover any vulnerable subdomains in your wordlist or your wordlist of is formatted weird.
