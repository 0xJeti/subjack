subjack is a Hostile Subdomain Takeover tool written in Go designed to scan a list of subdomains concurrently and identify ones that are able to be hijacked. With Go's speed and efficiency, this tool really stands out when it comes to mass-testing. Always double check the results manually to rule out false positives. 

## Installing

`go get -u github.com/haccer/subjack`

## How To Use:

`./subjack -w domains.txt -t 100 -timeout 30 -o results.txt -https`
- `-w domains.txt` is your list of subdomains.
- `-t` is the number of threads (Default: 10 threads). 
- `-timeout` is the seconds to wait before timeout connection (Default: 10 seconds).
- `-o results.txt` where to save results to (Optional).
- `-https` enforces https requests which may return a different set of results and increase accuracy (Optional).
- `-strict` sends HTTP requests to every URL (Optional).

## Practical Use

You can use [scanio.sh](https://gist.github.com/haccer/3698ff6927fc00c8fe533fc977f850f8) which is kind of a PoC script to mass-locate vulnerable subdomains using results from Rapid7's Project Sonar. This script parses and greps through the dump for desired CNAME records and makes a large list of subdomains to check with subjack if they're vulnerable to Hostile Subdomain Takeover. Of course this isn't the only method to get a large amount of data to test. **Please use this responsibly ;)**

## FAQ
**Q:** What should my wordlist look like?

**A:** Your wordlist should include a list of subdomains you're checking and should look something like:
```
assets.cody.su
assets.github.com
b.cody.su
big.example.com
cdn.cody.su
dev.cody.su
dev2.twitter.com
```

**Q:** I ran my scan and nothing happened. What does this mean?

**A:** In most cases, this means that subjack didn't discover any vulnerable subdomains in your wordlist or your wordlist of is formatted weird.
